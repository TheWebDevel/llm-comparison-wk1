### Scenario D – React Class to Hook Refactor with Unit Test (TypeScript)

#### ✅ What the model did right

1. **Refactor Accuracy**
   - Converted from class-based to functional component correctly using `useState`.
   - Preserved prop types via a clean `interface CounterProps` and typed function component (`React.FC<CounterProps>`).
   - Maintains functional equivalence: `count` state starts from `props.start` and increments on button click.
   - Logic encapsulated clearly inside `incrementCount` callback for readability and testability.

2. **Testing Coverage with `@testing-library/react`**
   - Renders the component with a valid `start` prop and asserts initial state is displayed.
   - Simulates multiple click events via `fireEvent.click()` and checks UI updates accordingly.
   - Uses `getByRole('button')`, which is semantically appropriate and avoids tight coupling to text content.
   - Tests are cleanly separated and properly scoped inside a `describe` block.

3. **Code Style & TypeScript Discipline**
   - Follows TSX conventions with proper imports (`import React from 'react'`).
   - Button label dynamically reflects current state without any hardcoded behavior.
   - Both component and test files are minimal, idiomatic, and production-ready.

#### ⚠️ Minor Notes (non-critical)

- Test file could optionally use `beforeEach` to DRY up repetitive `render(...)` calls for multiple test cases — not necessary for two simple tests.
- `React.FC` is slightly controversial in modern TypeScript React (some teams avoid it in favor of plain function declaration + explicit return type) — though not incorrect.

### ✅ Final Verdict

**Rating:** Excellent
The model’s output meets all criteria: functional parity with the original class component, type safety, and proper test coverage using React Testing Library.
It's clean, idiomatic, and ready to ship.
