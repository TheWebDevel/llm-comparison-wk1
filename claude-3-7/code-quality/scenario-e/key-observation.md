### Scenario E – ASP.NET Core Minimal API for `/users/{id:int}`

#### ✅ What Went Well

1. **Minimal API Design**
   - Implements `/users/{id:int}` using `MapGet` in a clean, idiomatic minimal-API style.
   - Uses dependency injection (`IUserRepository`) to abstract data access — aligns with best practices.
   - Correctly returns HTTP 404 for missing users via `Results.NotFound()`.

2. **Response Header (x-correlation-id)**
   - Dynamically generates a `Guid` per request and includes it via `WithHeaders()`.
   - Satisfies the requirement for appending the `x-correlation-id` header without external libraries.

3. **In-Memory Data Store**
   - `InMemoryUserRepository` simulates a user lookup with a hardcoded list of `User` objects.
   - LINQ-based search (`FirstOrDefault`) is appropriate for a small, testable in-memory store.

4. **Testing with xUnit + WebApplicationFactory**
   - Uses `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` for end-to-end test setup — correct and modern.
   - Test case 1 (`GetUser_WithValidId_ReturnsUser`) verifies:
     - Status code `200 OK`
     - Proper deserialization of the `User` object
     - Presence and non-emptiness of `x-correlation-id` header
   - Test case 2 (`GetUser_WithInvalidId_Returns404`) verifies:
     - Proper error status (`404 Not Found`)

5. **Code Style**
   - Clean organization, use of `partial Program` class to enable test visibility.
   - Modular separation of models, repository, and endpoint logic.

#### ⚠️ Minor Suggestions

- `WithHeaders()` is functional but slightly less idiomatic than manually adding headers via `HttpContext.Response.Headers`.
- Correlation ID is always generated — a minor improvement would be allowing inbound propagation (e.g., reading `Request.Headers["x-correlation-id"]` if present).
- No input validation test for invalid route values like `/users/abc` — although ASP.NET’s route binding would reject non-integer by default.

### ✅ Final Verdict

**Rating:** Excellent
The implementation meets all prompt requirements with well-structured, idiomatic ASP.NET Core 8 code and a complete integration test suite. A few optional improvements could enhance observability and header handling, but the current output is clean, correct, and production-aligned.
