### Scenario C ‚Äì Express Logger Middleware with Jest Testing

#### ‚úÖ What the model did right

1. **Middleware behavior**
   - Accurately tracks response time using `Date.now()` at entry and on `res.end()`.
   - Overrides `res.end()` to log after response finishes ‚Äî ensures accurate timing.
   - Restores original behavior via `originalEnd.call(this, ...)`, preserving stream semantics.
   - Output format (`${method} ${path} - ${responseTime}ms`) meets real-world logging expectations.

2. **Jest Test Suite**
   - **Mocks `req`, `res`, and `next()`** appropriately.
   - **Mocks `Date.now()`** with predictable timestamps ‚Äî ensures test determinism.
   - **Spies on `console.log`** and validates correct log format.
   - Validates:
     - That `next()` is invoked
     - That `res.end()` behaves as expected and receives the same args
     - That context (`this`) is preserved on `res.end()` call
   - Multiple test cases cover functional behavior, interaction correctness, and edge safety.

3. **Code Style & Structure**
   - Follows clear, idiomatic Node.js/Express patterns.
   - Modular: `middleware.js` and `middleware.test.js` separation is clean.
   - Uses `jest.fn()` and `jest.spyOn()` precisely ‚Äî no over- or under-mocking.
   - Test teardown via `mockRestore()` and `restoreAllMocks()` ensures no bleed-over between tests.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Notes (non-blocking)

- Could add an optional config for excluding certain routes or customizing the log format ‚Äî though **not required** per the prompt.
- No explicit Express version compatibility (e.g., res.end override could behave differently in rare cases with newer Node streams) ‚Äî acceptable in test/middleware context.

### üü¢ Final Verdict

**Rating: Excellent**

This solution is **prompt-compliant**, **production-accurate**, and **well-tested**.
The middleware handles timing and response lifecycle robustly, and the Jest suite exercises functionality and side-effects thoroughly.

No structural or correctness issues were found. Optional extensibility or stream compatibility checks could be added for enterprise use, but not expected for this scenario.
