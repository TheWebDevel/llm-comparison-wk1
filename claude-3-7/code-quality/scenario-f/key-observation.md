### Scenario F – LINQ Refactor to Remove Intermediate Lists

#### ✅ What Went Well

1. **Correct Refactor**
   - The `.ToList()` calls before and after the `Select()` were both removed appropriately.
   - The final query now chains `.Where() → .Select() → .Distinct()` without forcing eager evaluation.
   - This satisfies the requirement for **deferred execution** by using only LINQ-to-objects methods that return `IEnumerable<T>`.

2. **Accurate Performance Explanation**
   - The explanation is concise, clear, and technically correct.
   - Covers memory impact: by avoiding materialization, the pipeline remains lazy and efficient.
   - Notes that **time complexity stays O(n)**, while **memory overhead drops** from O(n) to O(1) in streamed scenarios.
   - Mentions **allocations and GC pressure** — useful insight for large datasets or high-throughput systems.

3. **Alignment with Prompt**
   - The response clearly addresses both parts of the prompt:
     - Refactor code ✅
     - Brief explanation of performance ✅ (within 5 bullets)

#### ⚠️ Minor Suggestions

- Final result is an `IEnumerable<int>` — a short mention that materialization (e.g., `.ToList()` or `.ToArray()`) may still be needed downstream could have shown full awareness.
- Could have noted that deferred execution can sometimes hide exceptions or delays until enumeration — important in production settings.

### ✅ Final Verdict

**Rating:** Good
The refactor is **precise and minimal**, and the performance commentary is technically sound.
This response meets both code quality and engineering explanation standards with no factual issues.
