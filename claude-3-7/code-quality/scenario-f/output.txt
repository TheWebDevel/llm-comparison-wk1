```csharp
var result = orders.Where(o => o.Total > 1000)
                   .Select(o => o.CustomerId)
                   .Distinct();
```

Performance impact:
1. Removed first `.ToList()` - Prevents materializing an intermediate collection, allowing the query to stream data through the pipeline
2. Removed final `.ToList()` - Enables deferred execution, so evaluation only happens when result is enumerated
3. Time complexity remains O(n), but memory usage improves from O(n) to O(1) for streaming operations
4. The query now uses less memory and avoids unnecessary allocations, especially beneficial for large datasets
5. Actual materialization is deferred until the result is needed, enabling potential further optimizations
