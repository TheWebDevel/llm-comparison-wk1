### Scenario B – Python Refactor with Time & Space Optimization

#### ✅ What the model did right

- Correctly replaced nested iteration with a **hash set lookup**, reducing time complexity from **O(n²) to O(n)**.
- Explanation is **factually correct, concise, and within the 50-word limit**.
- Code is readable and idiomatic Python: `complement = target - num` and `seen.add(num)` are clean one-liners.
- Output maintains correctness by checking complements before adding to the set — avoids duplicates without extra filtering.

#### ⚠️ Minor Areas to Improve

- No type hints or docstring (e.g., `-> List[Tuple[int, int]]`), which would be expected in production code or a senior engineer’s solution.
- The solution doesn't check for edge cases (e.g. empty input or non-integer elements), though not explicitly required by the prompt.
- Tuple order `(complement, num)` is valid, but could have been normalized (e.g. always (min, max)) to avoid ordering ambiguity in tests.

### ✅ Final Verdict

**Rating: Good**
The model’s solution is correct, clean, and prompt-compliant.
It would receive an “Excellent” rating with minor enhancements like type annotations, function documentation, or input validation polish.
