This functional component:
- Preserves the prop types (number for both start and count)
- Uses React hooks (useState) to manage state internally
- Has a clean, concise implementation that's easy to test
- Includes unit testing with @testing-library/react
- Uses proper TypeScript typing

The test case verifies that clicking the button increments the count correctly from 0 to 1. The component is now more suitable for production use as it:
- Avoids arrow functions in favor of standard functional components
- Uses modern React hooks appropriately
- Is properly typed with TypeScript
- Includes defensive testing
