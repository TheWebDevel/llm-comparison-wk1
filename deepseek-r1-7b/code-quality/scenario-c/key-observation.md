## 🔍 Key Observation

The model's generated code for this scenario is **not usable** and fails to meet even basic expectations:

### ❌ Middleware Issues
- Does not define a valid Express middleware signature: `(req, res, next)`.
- Uses fictional methods: `reqStart()`, `reqEnd()`, `res.resolve()`.
- Lacks use of standard Express techniques such as:
  - Overriding `res.end`
  - Hooking into `res.on('finish')` for measuring response time
- Misuses async logic and has no control over middleware flow or request lifecycle.

### ❌ Jest Test Problems
- Test setup includes hallucinated concepts: `jestCollector`, `mockResponse.timeout`.
- Lacks proper mocking of `req`, `res`, and `console.log`.
- No call to middleware function under test, no assertions tied to actual behavior.

### 📌 Summary
The generated solution appears hallucinated and non-functional. It does not run, does not follow Express or Jest patterns, and does not fulfill the core prompt requirements. A valid version would rely on overriding `res.end` or using `res.on('finish')`, and the test would require `jest.fn()` mocks with assertions on `console.log`.

### 🏁 Final Rating: `poor`
