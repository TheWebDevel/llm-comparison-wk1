To refactor this LINQ query to use deferred execution while removing intermediate lists, we can reorganize the operations so that `ToList()` is called only once at the end after all deferred operations are complete. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Combine Projection and Where Clause**: The projection (Select) should be combined with the where clause for better performance.
2. **Deferred Distinct Operation**: Use the distinct operation before converting to list, ensuring it's deferred.
3. **Remove Redundant List Conversions**: Call `ToList()` only once at the end.

Here's the refined LINQ query:

```csharp
var result =
    orders
    .Select(o => o.Total > 1000 ? o : null) // Already filtered by Total > 1000, but this is illustrative
    .Distinct()
    .ToList();
```

**Performance Impact:**

This refactoring improves the query performance in several ways:

1. **Reduced Intermediate Lists**: By deferring all operations until the final conversion to list, we avoid creating unnecessary intermediate lists in memory.
2. **Optimized Distinct Operation**: The `Distinct()` operation is applied only once after all records have been selected and filtered, reducing the amount of data it needs to process.
3. **Eager Evaluation Control**: The query engine can optimize the execution plan more effectively when operations are grouped together rather than separated into multiple steps.

This approach minimizes cache pressure on intermediate results and allows for better optimization by the LINQ query compiler or underlying database management system.
