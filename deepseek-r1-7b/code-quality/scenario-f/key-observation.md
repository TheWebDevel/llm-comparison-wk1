## 🔍 Key Observation

The refactored LINQ query fails to correctly implement deferred execution and introduces logical and semantic errors.

### 🚫 Code Issues
- `Select(o => o.Total > 1000 ? o : null)` injects `null` into the stream instead of filtering, risking runtime exceptions and violating the original logic.
- `Distinct()` is now applied to the entire `Order` object, not `CustomerId`, which changes the output intent.
- The result is a list of orders (some possibly `null`), not a list of unique customer IDs for orders over 1000.
- The refactor doesn’t preserve the meaning or structure of the original query.

### 🚫 Conceptual Mistakes
- Misinterprets “remove intermediate lists” as removing `Where` and replacing it with a conditional `Select`.
- Breaks the semantics of the original query: it no longer returns unique `CustomerId`s from filtered high-value orders.
- Adds unnecessary complexity and changes behavior under the guise of optimization.

### ✅ What Was Expected
- Preserve original filtering with `.Where(o => o.Total > 1000)`
- Project only `CustomerId` with `.Select(o => o.CustomerId)`
- Use `.Distinct()` for uniqueness
- Call `.ToList()` only once at the end

Correct refactor should be:
```csharp
var result = orders
    .Where(o => o.Total > 1000)
    .Select(o => o.CustomerId)
    .Distinct()
    .ToList();
````

This preserves semantics, ensures deferred execution, and eliminates unnecessary intermediate lists.

### 🏁 Final Rating: `Poor`

The solution introduces semantic bugs and diverges from the original intent. It is not a valid or functional refactor.
