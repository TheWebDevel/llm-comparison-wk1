Here's a clear SQL solution for your BigQuery requirement:

```sql
WITH events_unnested AS (
    SELECT
        COALESCE(extract(user_id FROM events), '') AS user_id,
        EXTRACT(ts FROM events) AS ts,
        UNNEST(extend_array(explode('payload.*'), 1)) AS payload_*
    FROM `your_table`
)
SELECT
    user_id,
    ts,
    payload_*
FROM events_unnested
LIMIT 100;
```

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

1. **UNNEST the JSON Column**: The outermost UNNEST breaks down each JSON object in the 'events' column into individual key-value pairs.

2. **Extract Specific Fields**: Using COALESCE and EXTRACT, we attempt to retrieve user_id and ts if they exist; otherwise, NULL is returned.

3. **Flatten Payload Array**: The payload.* field (an array) is unnested using UNNEST with an explode clause to convert it into individual key-value pairs.

4. **Result Structure**: The final table contains the three desired fields: user_id, ts, and all key-value pairs from payload. Each column will be NULL if the corresponding JSON property doesn't exist or was not specified.

**Notes:**

- **COALESCE**: Ensures that missing keys return NULL instead of throwing errors.
- **UNNEST(extend_array())**: Converts the nested array into a flat list, making it easier to extract fields using EXTRACT.
- **LIMIT 100**: Helps in testing by limiting output rows for practical purposes.

This approach efficiently handles JSON parsing and ensures graceful handling of missing keys while maintaining readability and clarity.
