To provide an SQL solution that meets your requirements, we'll write a query that:

1. Filters sales data for Q1 2025
2. Groups by region and item
3. Calculates revenue as qty * price
4. Uses window functions to rank items within each region's context
5. Limits results to top 3 per region

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    revenue,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS rank,
    item_id
FROM (
    SELECT
        s.revenue = s.qty * s.price as revenue,
        c.region,
        s.item_id
    FROM sales s
    JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
    WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-03-31'
) AS subquery
GROUP BY region, item_id
ORDER BY rank ASC,
        revenue DESC;
```

This query will:
- Calculate the revenue for each item
- Rank items within each region's context
- Filter results to top 3 per region
- Maintain deterministic ordering

The final result will be sorted by rank (ascending) and then by revenue (descending), ensuring consistent output.
