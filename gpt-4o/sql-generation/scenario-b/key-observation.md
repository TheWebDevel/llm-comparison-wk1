## âœ… Key Observation

### ðŸ”¹ Query Objective
- Converts JSON data in `events` column into structured tabular format.
- Extracts `user_id` and `ts` from top-level JSON.
- Dynamically accesses `payload.key1`, `key2`, `key3` from nested `payload` field.

### ðŸ”¹ Approach Highlights
- Uses `UNNEST([events])` to process JSON array records row-by-row.
- Applies `JSON_VALUE` and `JSON_QUERY` for structured and scalar extraction.
- Builds a temporary `STRUCT` for safely accessing nested keys.

### ðŸ”¹ Error & Edge Case Handling
- Missing keys return `NULL` via `JSON_VALUE`.
- `SAFE.` prefix can be added optionally to avoid runtime errors if structure is inconsistent.
- No crash on missing `payload` or its subfieldsâ€”graceful degradation ensured.

### ðŸ”¹ Notes for Usage
- Replace `key1`, `key2`, `key3` with actual expected payload fields.
- This solution is scalable for more fields by extending the `STRUCT`.
