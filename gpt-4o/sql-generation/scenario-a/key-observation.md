## âœ… Key Observation

### ðŸ”¹ Query Functionality
- Joins `sales` with `customers` to associate each sale with a region.
- Filters sales for **Q1 2025** using a date range.
- Aggregates revenue (`qty * price`) per `item_id` and `region`.
- Uses `RANK()` window function partitioned by region to assign revenue-based rank.
- Selects **top-3 items by revenue per region**.

### ðŸ”¹ SQL Best Practices Followed
- Uses ANSI-SQL compliant syntax.
- Employs `WITH` CTEs for readability and modular logic.
- Avoids subqueries in `SELECT`, improving maintainability.

### ðŸ”¹ Edge Case Handling
- Handles ties with `RANK()` (not `DENSE_RANK()`), which may include more than 3 items if tied at 3rd positionâ€”**intentional or acceptable** based on interpretation.
