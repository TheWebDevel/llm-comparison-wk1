## âœ… Key Observation: Terraform Module for Secure S3 Bucket Access

### ðŸ”¹ Module Purpose
- Creates a secure, encrypted S3 bucket with server-side logging.
- Grants least-privilege access (`GetObject`, `PutObject`) to a specific IAM role.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Functional Features
1. **Encryption**: Uses `AES256` encryption via `server_side_encryption_configuration`.
2. **Logging**: Configures the bucket to log access data to a dedicated logging bucket.
3. **Versioning + Lifecycle**: Enables versioning and adds cleanup rule for non-current versions after 30 days.
4. **IAM Policy**: Restricts access using a bucket policy scoped to a provided `role_arn`.

### ðŸ”¹ Error & Edge Case Handling
- Assumes both the logging bucket and IAM role already exist and are properly configured.
- `force_destroy = false` prevents accidental deletion of the bucket with objects.
- Versioning and lifecycle rule improve resilience and cost control but can be customized further.

### ðŸ”¹ Usage Context
- Can be used in compliance-heavy environments to ensure minimal access and traceability.
- Easily reusable with different bucket names and roles for multi-service isolation.
