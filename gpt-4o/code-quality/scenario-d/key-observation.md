## 🔍 Key Observation

The original class component is correctly refactored to a functional component using React Hooks in TypeScript.

### ✅ What Works Well
1. **Preserved Prop Types**: TypeScript `CounterProps` type ensures proper type safety for the `start` prop.
2. **Hook Usage**: Uses `useState` with functional updater (`c => c + 1`) to safely increment state.
3. **Behavior Match**: Functional component replicates the same click-to-increment behavior from the class version.
4. **Test Validity**: Unit test uses `@testing-library/react` to verify the button renders with the initial value and increments correctly on click.

### 📌 Minor Suggestions
- **Negative Test**: Add a negative test to ensure the button does not increment without a click.
- **Accessibility Improvement**: Add `aria-label` or `role="button"` for better accessibility and test robustness.

### ✅ What Was Expected
- React functional component using hooks
- TypeScript prop typing preserved
- Unit test using `@testing-library/react`
- Matches original class component behavior

### 🏁 Final Rating: `Excellent`
Clean conversion, strong type safety, and accurate testing make this a complete and effective implementation.
