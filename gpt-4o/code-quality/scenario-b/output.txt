```python
def find_pairs(nums, target):
    seen = set()
    pairs = set()
    for num in nums:
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            pairs.add((min(num, complement), max(num, complement)))
        seen.add(num)
    return list(pairs)
```

**Complexity Explanation:**
Original was **O(nÂ²)** time due to nested loops.
Refactored version is **O(n)** time and memory using a hash set for lookup and deduplication.
