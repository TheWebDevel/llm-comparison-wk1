## 🔍 Key Observation

The response correctly transforms the function to achieve O(n) time and memory complexity by eliminating nested loops and using hash-based lookups and deduplication.

### ✅ What Works Well
1. **Time Complexity Reduction**: Replaces O(n²) nested iteration with a single pass and constant-time set lookups, resulting in O(n) time.
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Uses two sets — one for seen numbers and another for storing unique pairs — achieving O(n) memory.
3. **Deduplication**: Handles symmetric duplicates (e.g., (3,7) and (7,3)) by ordering tuple elements with `min` and `max`.
4. **Correct Return Format**: Converts the set of tuples into a list, matching the original output type.

### 📌 Minor Suggestions for Improvement
- **Ordering of Results**: Final list of pairs is unordered due to set conversion. If deterministic output is needed, consider sorting before returning.
- **Pair Representation**: Uses `tuple` instead of `list`, which may differ from original usage expectations but remains valid in Python.

### ✅ What Was Expected
- A function with **O(n)** time and space
- No nested loops
- Handles duplicates gracefully
