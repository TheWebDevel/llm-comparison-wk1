```csharp
var result = orders
    .Where(o => o.Total > 1000)
    .Select(o => o.CustomerId)
    .Distinct()
    .ToList();
```

**Performance Impact:**
Eliminates unnecessary materialization with `ToList()`. Enables deferred execution until `ToList()` at the end, reducing memory usage and improving performanceâ€”especially with large collections or chained queries.
