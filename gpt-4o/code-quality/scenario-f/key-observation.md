## âœ… Key Observation

### ðŸ”¹ Refactoring Summary
- Removed the first `.ToList()` to **avoid intermediate list creation**.
- Now `Where`, `Select`, and `Distinct` operate using **deferred execution**, only materialized once with the final `.ToList()`.

### ðŸ”¹ Performance Gains
- Prevents unnecessary iteration and memory allocation between steps.
- Reduces overall CPU and memory overhead for large datasets.
- Enables better **pipeline efficiency**, especially when chaining additional LINQ operations.

### ðŸ”¹ Correctness
- Output remains identical.
- `Distinct()` still correctly deduplicates the selected customer IDs.
- Maintains readable and idiomatic C# LINQ usage.
