## 🔍 Key Observation

The submitted Express middleware correctly logs the HTTP method, path, and response time using only built-in features, with thorough Jest unit tests simulating request/response behavior.

### ✅ What Works Well
1. **Correct Middleware Logic**: Uses `res.on('finish')` to measure and log response duration, which ensures accurate timing after response is sent.
2. **POSIX-style Simplicity**: Avoids external dependencies per the prompt.
3. **Test Mocks**: Mocks both `Date.now()` and `res.on()` to simulate accurate timing and ensure deterministic test output.
4. **Coverage**: Confirms all key aspects — log message content, `res.on` binding, and `next()` call — with concise, effective tests.

### 📌 Minor Suggestions for Improvement
- **Robustness**: The mock `res.on` immediately invokes the callback. In more complex tests, triggering it after `next()` may better mirror Express lifecycle behavior.
- **Edge Case**: Could include an additional test to ensure no double logging or verify different HTTP methods.

### ✅ What Was Expected
- Logs method, path, and duration using only built-in Node APIs
- No external log libraries
- Unit tests using Jest and mocked req/res objects
- Accurate and verifiable response time logic

### 🏁 Final Rating: `Excellent`
The implementation is clean, testable, and adheres to prompt constraints. It delivers the correct functionality and structure with reliable unit testing.
