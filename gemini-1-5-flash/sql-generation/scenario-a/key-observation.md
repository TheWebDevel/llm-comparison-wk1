## 🔍 Key Observation

The SQL query correctly retrieves the top-3 items by revenue per region for Q1 2025 using ANSI-SQL standards.

### ✅ Query Strengths
- Uses a CTE (`regional_sales`) to isolate aggregation logic, improving readability.
- Filters Q1 2025 accurately using a half-open date range (`>= '2025-01-01' AND < '2025-04-01'`).
- Correctly calculates `revenue` as `SUM(qty * price)`.
- Implements `RANK()` with `PARTITION BY region` and `ORDER BY revenue DESC` to rank items per region.
- Filters to top-3 items using `WHERE item_rank <= 3`.
- Final result includes all required columns: `region`, `item_id`, `revenue`, and `item_rank`.

### ✅ What Was Expected
- Accurate use of aggregation and window function.
- Filtering for a specific date range (Q1 2025).
- Ranking logic scoped to `region`.
- Inclusion of required output columns.

### 🏁 Final Rating: `Excellent`
The solution is correct, idiomatic, and uses ANSI-compliant SQL. It meets all functional requirements with precise logic and clear structure.
