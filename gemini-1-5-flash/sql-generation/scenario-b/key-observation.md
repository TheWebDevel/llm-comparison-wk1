## üîç Key Observation

The generated solution partially addresses the prompt but falls short in core expectations around dynamic flattening and direct query use in BigQuery.

### üö´ Functional Issues
- **Unnecessary UDF**: Defines a user-defined function (`json_to_rows`) where none was asked for. Prompt expected a direct query.
- **No Use of `UNNEST` on Arrays/Objects**: The prompt explicitly called for using `UNNEST`, which is absent or misused (`UNNEST([json])` is a no-op).
- **Hardcoded Payload Keys**: Instead of generically flattening `payload.*`, it lists specific keys (`payload.key1`, etc.), which limits flexibility and does not scale.
- **No Graceful Key Detection**: The code assumes fixed payload structure rather than dynamically handling potentially missing or optional fields.
- **Doesn‚Äôt Flatten JSON into Columns**: The result returns a function call (`json_to_rows(events)`), not the flattened fields directly.

### ‚úÖ What Was Expected
- A single SQL query that:
  - Reads from a table with a JSON column (`events`)
  - Extracts `user_id` and `ts` using `JSON_VALUE` or `JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR`
  - Uses `UNNEST` to flatten array/object values under `payload.*`
  - Handles missing keys gracefully using `SAFE_CAST` or `IFNULL`
  - Returns flat columns: `user_id`, `ts`, and `payload.*`

### üèÅ Final Rating: `Poor`
The approach is over-engineered, uses unnecessary abstraction, and fails to meet the core technical expectations of JSON flattening via `UNNEST`. A full rewrite with direct SQL and dynamic handling of `payload.*` is needed.
