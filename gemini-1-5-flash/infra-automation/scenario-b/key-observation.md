## üîç Key Observation

The script intends to be a POSIX-compliant CI script for Docker build/push and Slack failure alerts, but it falls short due to logic flaws, portability issues, and misplaced error handling.

### üö´ Functional Issues
- **Incorrect Error Detection**: `if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]` is evaluated *after* all operations succeed due to `set -e`, making it unreachable and ineffective for detecting errors. Slack notification will **never** be triggered.
- **Non-POSIX Syntax**: `[[ ... ]]` is Bash-specific; POSIX requires `[ ... ]` or `test ...`.
- **Improper Variable Expansion**: `${COMMIT_HASH}` inside JSON payload is not quoted safely for POSIX; this can break in edge cases with special characters.
- **Lack of Error Handling**: No conditional checks for individual `docker` or `git` commands. If `docker build` fails, `set -e` exits immediately without sending Slack alert ‚Äî defeating the purpose.
- **ECR Target Missing**: The script uses placeholder `my-repo`, but pushing to ECR requires a full ECR URI like `123456789012.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-repo`.
- **Hardcoded Image Name**: Static `my-repo:latest` is used instead of a configurable image repository or environment variable, limiting CI flexibility.

### ‚úÖ What Was Expected
- A **POSIX-compliant** script with:
  - Error trapping using `trap` for Slack notification
  - Use of `[ ... ]` and `printf` for portability
  - Clearly defined variables for image name and ECR URI
  - Secure and proper `curl` invocation for Slack
  - Fallback-safe use of `git` for commit hash

### üèÅ Final Rating: `Poor`
Despite matching the basic structure, the script is **not POSIX-compliant**, does **not trigger Slack notifications on failure**, and has **hardcoded values** unsuitable for real CI. A complete rewrite is needed for correctness and robustness.
