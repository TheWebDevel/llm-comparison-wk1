## üîç Key Observation

The generated solution correctly implements the Express middleware with response time logging and includes meaningful Jest tests. It demonstrates a strong grasp of middleware chaining and mocking behavior.

### ‚úÖ Middleware Implementation
- Uses `Date.now()` to measure response time in milliseconds.
- Wraps `res.send` to inject logging logic post-response.
- Logs HTTP `method`, `path`, and `response time` clearly.
- Maintains Express middleware signature and compatibility.

### ‚úÖ Test Suite Quality
- Mocks `console.log` effectively to verify output without external libraries.
- Tests both `GET` and `POST` methods, confirming HTTP verb flexibility.
- Ensures compatibility with additional middleware in the stack.
- Uses `supertest` appropriately to simulate requests.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Suggestions
- Could improve log message formatting for easier parsing in production (e.g., JSON-style logs).
- Does not test edge cases like no response body or errors ‚Äî although not required by prompt, these would improve robustness.

### ‚úÖ What Was Expected
- A fully working Express middleware that logs method, path, and response time.
- No reliance on external logging libraries.
- Jest tests validating correct logging under typical usage patterns.

### üèÅ Final Rating: `Excellent`
The solution is correct, readable, production-ready, and fully tested. It adheres to the prompt strictly and includes a thoughtful, maintainable design.
