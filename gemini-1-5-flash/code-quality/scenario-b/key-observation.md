## 🔍 Key Observation

The refactored function meets the prompt’s performance goals, achieving **O(n) time and memory** using a hash set. However, it **does not preserve the original behavior**, making the solution only partially correct.

### ✅ Performance Improvements
- Removes nested loops, reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).
- Uses a set (`seen`) for O(1) complement lookup.
- Maintains a single pass over the input list.

### 🚫 Behavioral Issues
- **Output Order**: The original loop ensures `i < j`, so pairs like `(2, 3)` and `(3, 2)` are not equivalent. The new version reverses that guarantee.
- **Duplicate Pairs**: It allows the same logical pair (e.g., `(2, 3)` and `(3, 2)`) to appear multiple times if the elements repeat in the list.
- **Symmetry**: The refactor outputs `(num, complement)` in the order they're encountered, not respecting the original input index constraints.

### ✅ What Was Expected
- Same performance improvement.
- Preserved semantic behavior: no reversed or duplicate logical pairs.
- Clear and consistent pair formatting—ideally `(min, max)` or ordered by original indices.

### 🏁 Final Rating: `Basic / Limited`
Although the function meets the O(n) goal, it fails to replicate the original logic’s correctness and introduces subtle behavioral bugs. It works only for simple, non-repeating cases and needs refinement to be production-ready.
