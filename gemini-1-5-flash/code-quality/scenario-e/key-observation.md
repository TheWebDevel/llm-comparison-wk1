## 🔍 Key Observation

The generated solution delivers a working ASP.NET Core 8 minimal API with proper route handling, response headers, and xUnit tests using `WebApplicationFactory`.

### ✅ Endpoint Implementation
- Uses `.MapGet("/users/{id:int}", ...)` correctly to handle typed routing.
- Returns `404 NotFound` when the user is not found — aligns with prompt.
- Adds `"x-correlation-id"` header to every response using middleware.
- Uses `record` for the `User` model, promoting immutability.

### ✅ Test Implementation
- Implements tests with `WebApplicationFactory<Program>`, as required.
- Verifies response codes, content, and presence of `x-correlation-id`.
- Checks both positive (found user) and negative (not found) scenarios.
- Validates content type for correctness (`application/json`).

### ⚠️ Minor Notes
- The users list is declared outside the builder, which works but isn’t scoped or injected — might not scale well.
- Middleware adds a new correlation ID per request, which is fine for demonstration, but production might use an inbound header or tracing context.

### ✅ What Was Expected
- ASP.NET Core 8 minimal API with `/users/{id:int}` route.
- Returns appropriate status codes with a custom header.
- Uses xUnit tests with `WebApplicationFactory`.
- Happy path + negative test coverage.

### 🏁 Final Rating: `Excellent`
The submission meets all prompt requirements with a clean and idiomatic implementation. Tests are robust and correctly validate the API behavior and headers.
